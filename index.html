    <p class="question-one">Explain how you use 'fetch' in JavaScript for network requests and how you handle responses?</p>
    <div class="Answer1">In JavaScript, we use fetch for network requests, which is a promise-based function. First, we send a request using fetch, then we handle the response using various methods like .then() and .catch() on the returned promise.</div>
    <p class="question-two">What is the difference between map(), filter(), and reduce() in JavaScript, and when do you use each of them?</p>
    <div class="Answer2">The functions map(), filter(), and reduce() in JavaScript are used for processing and transforming data. map() is used to change and transform each array element, filter() is used to filter elements based on a condition, and reduce() is used to reduce an array to a single value.</div>
    <p class="question-three">Explain how you use async and await for managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript?</p>
    <div class="Answer3">We use async and await to write code that runs asynchronously and manages asynchronous operations better. We use async to define an asynchronous function, and await to wait for a promise to be resolved.</div>
    <p class="question-four">Explain how you add an event listener to a DOM element and how you work with events?</p>
    <div class="Answer4">To add an event listener to a DOM element, we use the addEventListener() method. This method allows us to add a function as a listener for a specific event related to the DOM element. Then, we work with the event using the data passed to the listener function.</div>
    <p class="question-five">Explain how you use localStorage and sessionStorage in JavaScript for storing and retrieving local data and what is the difference between them?</p>
    <div class="Answer5">We use localStorage and sessionStorage in JavaScript to store local data in the browser. localStorage stores data permanently in the browser, whereas sessionStorage stores data only for the current browser session and removes it after closing the browser window.</div>
